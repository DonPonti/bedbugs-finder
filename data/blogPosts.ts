    "content": `A vacation can be quickly ruined by the discovery of pests in your hotel room. Bedbugs, in particular, are notorious for hitchhiking in luggage and infesting homes. To protect yourself, always perform a quick inspection upon arrival.

1. **Inspect the Bed:** This is the most critical step. Pull back the linens and check the mattress and box spring seams for dark spots (fecal matter), tiny eggs, or the bugs themselves. Pay close attention to the headboard area.

2. **Check Furniture:** Bedbugs don't just live in beds. Inspect upholstered chairs, sofas, and curtains. Use your phone's flashlight for a better view in dark corners.

3. **Use the Luggage Rack:** Keep your suitcase off the floor and away from the walls. The metal luggage rack is the safest spot. Avoid unpacking your clothes into hotel drawers.

4. **Seal Your Belongings:** When not in use, keep your luggage zipped up. You can also store your belongings in sealed plastic bags as an extra precaution.

5. **Post-Trip Inspection:** When you return home, inspect your luggage outdoors before bringing it inside. Wash all your clothes in hot water, even those you didn't wear, to kill any potential stowaways.`

    "title": "Understanding Hotel Cleanliness Ratings and What They Mean",
    "author": "Alex Smith, Travel Expert",
    "date": "2024-07-15",
    "category": "Travel Tips",
    "excerpt": "You see cleanliness scores on booking sites, but what do they really mean? We break down the ratings and explain how to use them to choose a safer hotel.",
    "image": "https://picsum.photos/seed/blog-ratings/800/600",
    "content": `Hotel cleanliness ratings are often a key factor for travelers, but they can be misleading. A high score doesn't always guarantee a pest-free environment. These ratings are often based on general tidiness, such as vacuumed floors and clean bathrooms, not specific pest inspections.

Our community-sourced data at BedBug Tracker provides a more targeted look at a hotel's pest history. While official ratings are a good starting point, supplementing them with real-world reports from other travelers gives you a more complete picture. Always cross-reference information to make the best decision for your health and peace of mind. A hotel might look spotless, but a recent bedbug report from a fellow traveler is a major red flag that general ratings won't show you.`

    "excerpt": "Learn about why we started BedBug Tracker and our mission to create a transparent, community-driven resource for safer travel.",
    "image": "https://picsum.photos/seed/blog-story/800/600",
    "content": `BedBug Tracker was born from a frustrating travel experience. After a stay in what seemed like a pristine hotel, one of our founders returned home with bedbugs. The existing hotel reviews were unhelpful, filled with vague comments that didn't address the real issue. We realized there was a need for a dedicated platform where travelers could share specific, factual reports about pests.

By using a simple, open-source model with data stored on GitHub, we've made the entire process transparent. Every report is visible, and the history is public. This is about empowering travelers with the information they need to travel confidently. Your contributions are what make this platform work, and together, we can encourage higher standards of cleanliness across the industry.`
