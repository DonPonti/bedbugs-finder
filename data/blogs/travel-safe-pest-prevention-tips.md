A vacation can be quickly ruined by the discovery of pests in your hotel room. Bedbugs, in particular, are notorious for hitchhiking in luggage and infesting homes. To protect yourself, always perform a quick inspection upon arrival.

1. **Inspect the Bed:** This is the most critical step. Pull back the linens and check the mattress and box spring seams for dark spots (fecal matter), tiny eggs, or the bugs themselves. Pay close attention to the headboard area.

2. **Check Furniture:** Bedbugs don't just live in beds. Inspect upholstered chairs, sofas, and curtains. Use your phone's flashlight for a better view in dark corners.

3. **Use the Luggage Rack:** Keep your suitcase off the floor and away from the walls. The metal luggage rack is the safest spot. Avoid unpacking your clothes into hotel drawers.

4. **Seal Your Belongings:** When not in use, keep your luggage zipped up. You can also store your belongings in sealed plastic bags as an extra precaution.

5. **Post-Trip Inspection:** When you return home, inspect your luggage outdoors before bringing it inside. Wash all your clothes in hot water, even those you didn't wear, to kill any potential stowaways.
