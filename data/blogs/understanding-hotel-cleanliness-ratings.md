Hotel cleanliness ratings are often a key factor for travelers, but they can be misleading. A high score doesn't always guarantee a pest-free environment. These ratings are often based on general tidiness, such as vacuumed floors and clean bathrooms, not specific pest inspections.

Our community-sourced data at BedBug Tracker provides a more targeted look at a hotel's pest history. While official ratings are a good starting point, supplementing them with real-world reports from other travelers gives you a more complete picture. Always cross-reference information to make the best decision for your health and peace of mind. A hotel might look spotless, but a recent bedbug report from a fellow traveler is a major red flag that general ratings won't show you.
