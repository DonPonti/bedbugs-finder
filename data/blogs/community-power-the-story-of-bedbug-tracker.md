BedBug Tracker was born from a frustrating travel experience. After a stay in what seemed like a pristine hotel, one of our founders returned home with bedbugs. The existing hotel reviews were unhelpful, filled with vague comments that didn't address the real issue. We realized there was a need for a dedicated platform where travelers could share specific, factual reports about pests.

By using a simple, open-source model with data stored on GitHub, we've made the entire process transparent. Every report is visible, and the history is public. This is about empowering travelers with the information they need to travel confidently. Your contributions are what make this platform work, and together, we can encourage higher standards of cleanliness across the industry.
